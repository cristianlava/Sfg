      <p>The game is coming to an end! This can is both a very proud and happy moment for me, as well as a sad one. This game has span almost a full year, which is hard to believe.Its awesome you guys stuck it out and are around to finish the fight!</p>
      <p>The original lineup (Alyzara, Biron, Crow and Daystrom) started off doing things in the city of Frostheim. They got up to all sorts of whacky events including breaking and entering into a prison. Not too far after
			the character Raymond merged back into the land of the living and joined the group! The party then went on a series of adventures that would lead to the ground finding the Deck of Many Things! What they didn't expect was to draw 2 Comet cards (Alyzara) and for Raymond to draw Balance! Raymond then went on 
			a series of massacres with the wild card Crow. After revealing his true intentions he has become the biggest known threat to the world! The group at their lowest point met a paladin of Bahamut, named Xandar! Having a common interest in a third party Xandar joined the party
			and now wants to bring Raymond back from the brink of madness and cruelty. This is truly the Order of the Phoenix's darkest hour!</p>
